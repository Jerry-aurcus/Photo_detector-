### 1. Introduction

Zinc oxide (ZnO) is a highly promising material for ultraviolet (UV) photodetectors due to its wide bandgap (\~3.3 eV), high exciton binding energy (\~60 meV), intrinsic n-type conductivity, and excellent chemical stability. Its nanostructured morphologies can significantly enhance device performance through increased surface area, directional charge transport, and efficient light–matter interaction.

### 2. Why ZnO for UV Photodetectors?

* **Wide Bandgap (\~3.3 eV):** Strong UV sensitivity, transparent to visible light.
* **High Exciton Binding Energy:** Enhances photoresponse at room temperature.
* **High Electron Mobility:** Promotes fast carrier transport.
* **n-Type Conductivity:** Naturally conductive due to oxygen vacancies.
* **Morphology Tunability:** Can form nanorods, nanowires, sheets, and films.
* **Low Cost and Non-toxic:** Abundant and eco-friendly.
